    <p class="font-sans mt-5">
        When ordering food through a menu card provided on the flight, passengers are limited to the menu options, and may have to wait for a flight attendant to take their order and bring them their food. This can lead to longer wait times and limited options for passengers with dietary restrictions or preferences.
    </p>
    
    <p class="font-sans mt-3">In a conversation with my many friends and people who regularly travel via flights, two interesting insights came out:</p>
    
    <p class="border-l-2 border-black pl-10 mt-10 ml-10 italic font-serif">‚ÄúAsking for the Menu from the flight attendant is tough because I&#39;m shy and reluctant to talk in public. Also, it becomes a peer-pressure to order something at the end due to the fear of judgement by the people around.‚Äù</p>
    
    <p class="border-l-2 border-black mt-4 pl-10 ml-10 italic font-serif">‚ÄúI have to wait for the physical menu card to come to me. Alongside, menu cards have many germs which are capable for infecting. I have become more conscious about their hygiene post Covid-19 pandemic.‚Äù</p>

        <p class="mt-3">3. <span class="font-semibold bg-red-200">Special dietary requirements: </span> Passengers with dietary restrictions or preferences, such as vegetarians or people with food allergies, may appreciate the ability to order food that meets their specific needs.</p>

        <li>Get comfortable with the critique. Its totally okay if you dont get the desired feedback you were expecting. Having a thirst to learn brings the best out of you.</li>
        <li>It is not necessary to follow the conventional design style. For example- It wasnt necessary to make a Bottom NavBar with four different icons. However, it served as a cart value and the duration of the flight</li>
        <li>It was a unique problem in itself and it would be nearly impossible to put myself in the shoes of the user</li>
        <li>Following the competetion of user interveiw, it was benificial to craft a compehrive summary that interconnects key points and highlights common themes or issues identified by all interveiwees. This approach contributed to a  deeper Understanding of reccuring patterns. The valuable insight gained from my intership underscores the potential to significatly elevate the efficiany of user interview</li>

    <p>The oppurtunity to work on inclusive design and in particular, designing for blind users was absolutely wonderful and i loved it!</p>
    <p>This experience has not only improved my professional skills but also left an <span class="font-semibold">impact</span> on how I <span class="font-semibold">percieve</span> the <span class="font-semibold">role of technology </span> in <span class="font-semibold">creating</span> an <span class="font-semibold">inclusive world. Prioritizing accessiblity </span>over anything was the <span class="font-sembold">most challenging part</span>. This meant stepping into the shoes of blind users.

    <p>Many thnaks for sticking with it. I hope you all found it useful ‚ú®</p>
